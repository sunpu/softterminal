    @brief Returns an attribute of mixed streams which distinguishes them from
    other mixed streams a conference room provides.
    @details A conference room, since Intel CS for WebRTC v3.4 and later, has
    been extended to support multiple presentations of the mixed audio and video
    for variant purposes. For example, in remote education scenario, the teacher
    and students may subscribe different mixed streams with view of 'teacher'
    and 'student' respectively in the same class conference room. It is also the
    label of a mixed stream indicating its peculiarity with a meaningful
    string-typed value, which must be unique within a room.
